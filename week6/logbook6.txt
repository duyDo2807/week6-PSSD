GoodHours:
- Initial thoughts: At first when reading the rules of the problem, I get how Johnny likes some moments of the clock, but still don't get it when it comes to 2 moments beforeTime and afterTime, while we only need one string moment to calculate the good hour. But after reading the rules more carefully, I found out that we have to return the total moments of good hours between these two moments string inclusively, which is more complicated than normal. For this problem, at first, I thought of setting up each variable H1, H2, M1, M2 for saving time into the variables first (converting  string to integer) and a variable count to return the final result, then use 4 for-loops to iterate each digit. Through some calculations, we will increase the count by one through each loop if the condition is satisfied. After finishing all 4 loops, return the final result.
- Reflections: The output ran as I expected. But to ensure easy readings, I decide to convert to minutes directly for easy one for-loop and vice versa; and also included those functions into the private part of the code. The bool function to check calculations is also included in the private part to convert each hour and minute to interger and check if one of 3 calculations is correct and return true, else false. Overall, the code is now fairly easy to read and be implemented by others.
I got a bit of output errors due to forgetting when the minutes after are lower than the minutes before. But it is fixed now.
